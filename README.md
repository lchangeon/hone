<i>Hone</i> (say honé literally “Bone” in Japanese) is a PHP framework designed to implement websites or 
web applications. <i>Hone</i> is simple and light, its architecture based on MVC 
(Model / View / Controller) pattern will allow you to organize your code and 
distinguish the roles within your modules.

## Database Engine Abstraction

<p>
At an architecture level, data access management is based on a DAO pattern that allows 
you to abstract the way data is stored. This abstraction is found at a technical level 
through the use of the PDO extension which also guarantees greater security, in particular 
by preventing malicious SQL injections. <br>
<i>Hone</i> thus allows you to have greater technical independence from your database engine.

## Template engine

<p>
The view management block is built around Smarty template engine, whose power and 
ease of use are well established.

## About this repository

<p>The source code available in this repository is a website template. 
A few pages of content and full member management system will allow you to appreciate the 
flexibility and power of the framework. It will be easy for you to adapt this template 
or capitalize on it in order to implement your project.</p>

<p>Here are some screenshots taken from the template website :</p>
